# lncm-pos-redirect
Static Redirection service powered by github actions

## How it works

The service requires that the public key for the private key (stored in the secrets for this project) is copied to ```authorized_keys``` on the target onion host.

Once this is done, the github action can copy either to the host or from. In this case, I'm copying a file from the box which is generated by cron. Eventually I'd like to have this file run on the fly so there is full auditability of whats running on there rather than a black box.
